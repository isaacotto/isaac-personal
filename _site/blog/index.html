<p class="par2"><!-- At the nascent stage of this little research project, I've been so starving for candid, well-informed discussion of the bones of the LRM, that I took a truly desperate measure and spoke to ChatGPT on the topic. -->
<p>At the moment, I'm really just trying to formulate an objection to the way IFLA models relations between work, expression, manifestation, and item. The ontology of (musical) works is far from settled science, so I'm aware that I'm opening a much larger can of worms than I may be prepared to deal with, but this should at least serve as a gateway into bigger discussions that tie in my thoughts on notation as work-mediator.</p>
<p>One problem that keeps pebbling around my brain is the issue of the <em>uncaptured expression</em>.</p>
<p>Per IFLA LRM documentation:</p>
<ol>
<li>An expression comes into being with the creation of its first manifestation.</li>
<li>An expression <em>cannot exist</em> without an associated manifestation.</li>
<li>A manifestation requires a <em>carrier</em> and results from the capture of one or more expressions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yet we have no difficulty conceiving of a musical work whose only expression remains uncaptured: any work premiered prior to the invention of recorded sound, for instance. Per the LRM, these uncaptured performances cannot be, at least bibliographically speaking, expressions at all, unless we were to define &quot;capture&quot; and &quot;carrier&quot; extraordinarily liberally.</p>
<p>As much as I'd like it to, the LRM doesn't set out to be an account of the ontology of creative works, merely a model by which we organize bibliographic universes.
The party line, presumably, would be that uncaptured expressions won't have directly associated manifestations and items, ergo, they need not be considered bibliographically salient entities.</p>
<p>As such, the lack of an account of these &quot;ephemeral entities&quot; does not pose any particular issue for the cataloger. By the time an item ends up in her hands, it will have come down the long chain from artistic conception to mass production, ensuring that relevant work, expression, manifestation entities exist to be documented.</p>
<p>A small but important objection may be raised here, though. We might imagine the following scenario:</p>
<p>An eighteenth-century opera critic is attending the premiere of a new work. He speeds home after the performance to write his review which is subsequently published in a local periodical.</p>
<p>The opera, sadly, only runs for a short time and is quickly forgotten. It was a quickly-thrown-together production and left no published scores (and given the time period no recordings either).</p>
<p>Three centuries later, a cataloger comes across our critic's review in a collection of opera criticism and wants to describe the relationship between this work of criticism and its subject.</p>
<p>If our critic were discussing a Mozart arrangement, our cataloger might use the (Official RDA) element</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[criticism] --&gt; critique of expression --&gt; [arrangement]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to describe this relationship.</p>
<p>However, given that the opera he discusses leaves no bibliographic trace in the form of captured scores or recordings, our element &quot;critique of expression&quot; therefore has no valid range: the uncaptured performance does not constitute a bibliographically salient expression of its work, despite the fact that bibliographic evidence (e.g. the review) would imply the existence of some work and its (ephemeral) expression.</p>
<p>More soon...</p>

<h1 class="h1" style="color:#555555">

<!-- <p class="par2"></p> -->
<p class="par2"><p>Okay, but what really is the difference between &quot;concrete&quot; directives and ekphrastic ones? Do we really have to appeal to cognitive sciences to draw a functional distinction? <em>fff</em> is a <em>symbol</em> which denotes (both) a <em>quality</em> of resultant sound (a relative degree---i.e. sound considerably louder than that which is marked <em>ppp</em>) as well as an <em>instruction</em> to a performer (i.e. play in a particular way such that this quality of sound is achieved.</p>
<p><em>It could be replaced 1:1 with explanatory text describing the sound quality without any loss of composer intention. It could be substituted with any other symbol bearing the same semantic content.</em> [This quality characterizes a musical directive, I think...]</p>
<p>Now if we consider a different directive &quot;∵&quot; which the composer keys as &quot;play this passage like a tree&quot; (not far fetched, thinking of composers at least as far back as Satie) we appear to have a symbol functioning in the same way---but it's pure trompe l'œil.</p>
<p>The shorthand glyph ∵ itself bears semantic content---the composer gives it to us in the key. But beneath that... the directive itself is semantically empty. There is no broadly agreed-upon fact of the matter as to what it would be like to &quot;play like a tree&quot;.</p>
<p>Naturally, the composer could simply define for the player in natural language some intended rhythmic or timbral effect he hopes to achieve with the directive---loading the directive with semantic content &quot;manually&quot;. But this does nothing for us as score-archæologists, well-removed from the rehearsal space where any oral clarifications might have been given.</p>
<p>I take it, anyway, that a composer employing such a curious directive does so because he's interested in the <em>friction</em> generated by the collision between the semantic and the asemantic in notation. This is an underappreciated phenomenon! &quot;Asemantic dissonance,&quot; or something.</p>
<p>It seems like <em>the</em> important attribute of the asemantic, ekphrastic directive is that it <em>cannot</em> be substituted---swapped out for an equivalent plain-English directive with concrete musical referents without ceasing to function <em>as</em> an ekphrastic directive.</p>
<p>Furthermore, any other seemingly equivalent or complementary directive (&quot;play like you have leaves and branches&quot;; &quot;play like you're made of wood&quot;; &quot;play like a <em>fir</em> tree&quot;) all irrevocably change the nature of the ekphrasis. <strong>Performing ekphrastic musical inscription is tantamount to the translation of a poem, in contrast with the translation of an Ikea instruction manual!</strong></p>

<p>Hasty thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything scored that results in music is some form of <em>INSCRIPTION</em>.</li>
<li>Inscriptions may be either <em>SEMANTIC</em> or <em>ASEMANTIC</em>.</li>
<li>Semantic inscriptions (notations) carry concrete meaning directly from composer to performer and come in three flavors:
<ol>
<li><em>RESULT</em> - intended to bring about a particular sound</li>
<li><em>RECIPE</em> - intended to bring about a particular process</li>
<li><em>ACTION</em> - use visual metaphor to effect congruent gesture</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Asemantic inscriptions (graphics; drawings) are semantically EMPTY and come in two flavors:
<ol>
<li><em>VERBAL</em> - semantically empty words or phrases (&quot;play like a tree&quot;)</li>
<li><em>GLYPHIC</em> - un-coded drawings</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Semantic inscriptions of all types lie somewhere between wholly <em>FIXED</em> and wholly <em>OPEN</em>; that is, the final product (<em>SOUND</em>; <em>ACTION</em>) is determined to some level of strictness before play begins.</li>
<li>Semantic inscriptions are <em>READ</em> in the traditional sense. We follow the instructions they denote, resulting in (sound; action).</li>
<li>Asemantic inscripions instead require a different process called <em>EKPHRASIS</em> by which we &quot;translate&quot; one form of media (text; image) to another (sound; action).</li>
<li>Ekphrasis and reading may be combined in various and interesting ways.</li>
<li>That's how we get to the year 3000.</li>
</ul>

<!-- <p class="par2"></p> -->
<p class="par2"><p>Let's assume, per the <a href="https://www.ifla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/assets/cataloguing/frbr-lrm/ifla-lrm-august-2017_rev201712.pdf">IFLA LRM</a>, that the conceptual and real artifacts resulting from musicking (or indeed any art-making) can be meaningfully broken down into mutually exclusive entities: works, expressions, manifestations, and items.</p>
<p>The song &quot;Body and Soul&quot;---that is, the collection of attributes that identify something as belonging to the &quot;Body and Soul&quot; family---is the work. This work is manifested in many expressions---recorded performances, transcriptions into traditional notation, string quartet arrangements, highly abstract versions for solo harp, reharmonized versions with new lyrics. Each of these expressions, the model claims, only comes into being once the symbols or signs that identify it are captured on one or more carriers: the sound is recorded to phonodisc; the notes are written down on manuscript paper.</p>
<p>One expression (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jTWvgOJbNk">Coleman Hawkins' seminal 1939 recording</a>, let's say) might have many associated manifestations---the original shellac; part of a compilation re-released on LP; the CD re-master. Finally, each of these manifestations. Finally each of these manifestations will have one or more associated items---physically-extended things onto which one might drop a needle.</p>
<p>This is the beating heart of how we organize information into bibliographic &quot;universes&quot; of entities and collections of attributes. A core tenet of the model holds that each of these four categories of entity (there are many more) are mutually exclusive. The <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/2996680-Wagner-B%C3%B6hm-Tristan-Und-Isolde-Bayreuth-1966">1966 Deutsche Grammophon recording of Tristan</a> is not itself a work---rather, it is a manifestation of a particular expression (say, a particular orchestral arrangement) of the work Tristan composed by Richard Wagner.</p>
<p>Take, though, a virtuosic piano reduction of the Tristan's prelude. The model grants a measure of leeway here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...the exact criteria that delimit instances of the work entity are not governed by the model. As a result, the model does not prescribe the level of adaptation required so that a given expression based on an existing expression should be regarded as just another expression of the same work, rather than as an expression of a distinct work.&quot; (pg. 10)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here an analyst may decide that the piano reduction shares enough expression-level attributes with the representative expression that we may fairly call it an expression of the original work (a secondary or subsidiary expression or some such.) Or she may decide that the reduction so transforms the representative expression as to merit consideration as an expression of a wholly distinct work (the work being, I guess, Tristan for Piano or something).</p>
<p>This leeway seems appropriate given that what precisely constitutes a work or an instance of that work varies contextually---and the LRM's documentation points this out. This raises some interesting questions---indeed gives us a new way to ask &quot;what constitutes a musical work?&quot;.</p>
<p>I find myself wondering, though, what the consequences might be if we allow that some thing (a conceptual thing, in this case) might be allowed to have both work-level and expression-level attributes? If, rather than pointing to some new work like Tristan for Piano, our new expression expresses work-level attributes associated with that representative expression? Maybe I phrased that badly...</p>
<p>To put it another way---we think of &quot;has as composer&quot; as a work-level relationship and &quot;has as arranger&quot; as an expression-level relationship. These are mutually exclusive: a work cannot have an arranger and an expression cannot have a composer. But it seems that in some cases, we might want to conclude that a complex, transformative arrangement might be composed twice---at two different levels.</p>
<p>Speaking from a purely intuitive point of view: If I substantively transform a work (new harmonies and/or new rhythms and/or new libretto and/or ...) , I feel as though I'm creating both an expression of the original work and a wholly new work simultaneously. The one conceptual entity that results (my &quot;Tristan for Piano&quot;) seems like it might fairly have attributes of both work and expression concurrently, all in the same bibliographic universe---an intolerable situation for the LRM. I just don't find the present party line of &quot;pick one to suit your needs&quot; fully satisfying but I'm not smart enough yet to really dig into what I'm feeling...</p>

<!-- <p class="par2"></p> -->
<p class="par2"><p>Atticus gave me <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mingus_Plays_Piano">Mingus Plays Piano</a> (Impulse!, 1964) which I'd either never heard or heard so long ago as to have forgotten it. Phenomenal, personal album. I resist reading (as some might) his self-conscious-but-never-affected slop as a reflection of some DSM pathology...</p>
<p>I think of it rather as a key stylistic element---a major creative factor in his work into which he leans quite deliberately. His left-hand ostinato fails in &quot;Myself When I Am Real&quot; when he develops an idea in the right because the pursuit of that little idea is more critical than the grid. That point of failure becomes a &quot;clumsy&quot; inflection point---not the sort of thing to be easily transcribed---marking the shift in attention from one gesture to another. And while it is the (points A and B) gestures that form the foreground of the work, the bits one might play if one covered the piece, the slop in between leaves a strong imprint; tints the work in a beautiful, original way that we don't yet know how to notate.</p>
<p>Likewise, it's clear to me that when Mingus (elsewhere) leans hard on an A♮ on the downbeat of a B♭m7 in the first measure of &quot;I X Love&quot; (&quot;Duke's Choice&quot;), he's doing something more than milking a leading tone for its friction, he's expressing that liminal &quot;slop&quot; harmonically. The chord really is a split seventh and that set---however briefly expressed on its way to its local resolution---defines the work in a way that it wouldn't in a normal, cadential figure.</p>
<p>The slop that reviewers reductively attribute to Mingus' lack of experience on the instrument (&quot;He's no virtuoso, but nevertheless...&quot;) plays out too in uneven melodic figurations---trills and brief runs in the head to &quot;Memories of You&quot; that clearly evoke Tatum (with whom he studied for a while, someone said) but which, contra Tatum, sputter and flam where they need to. This is an critical (a/e)ffect which Mingus carries with him into his role as a bandleader and suffuses his entire corpus, and is so key to the music's sublimity (mostly absent, I think, in the tribute records I've heard---I'd be happy to be wrong).</p>
<p>I guess I just lament that for a hundred reasons I mostly hear this sort of &quot;calculated&quot; failure play out in more wholly improvised musics and less in highly-idiomatic musics like jazz now---I want to be more confused about what's going on!</p>

I certainly don't purport to know anything about film scoring, but I found myself &quot;taken out&quot; of the theater, especially toward the climax and denouement of the film, by a few of the soundscapes that seemed overbearing; incongruous with the spirit or tone of the film.</p>
<p>At first blush the hour-plus-long score, composed by Robin Carolan (who collaborated with Eggers in 2022 on The Northman) suits the subject matter; gravity of the film just fine. Per its official unofficial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YwhJT9DdO8">YouTube upload by user azc0na</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[t]he score revolves around one main motif, one that represents Count Orlok himself as well as the threat he poses for the world at large. It's a very simple four note motif that is twisted and played upon, often acting as a backbone for other motifs to sprout off of. It's played on low, dark strings, cellos, a music box for the opening credits, and a lone child soprano. Throat singing and low choral moaning is also used to enhance the atmosphere, and a [sic] whirring, downward droning strings show the twisted nature of his malevolence [...].&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Listening back, though... While I don't doubt that a great deal of care underlay the interleaving of the score's motifs, it's difficult for me to hear past the well-worn Hollywood film scoring tropes to the cogent composition beneath. Competent string writing is rudely butted-in-on by a disembodied, rumbly synth sub-bass that doesn't belong anywhere near a period piece like this, let alone one that pays homage to '20s masterpiece cinema. Ligetian; Pendereckian micro-polyphony is cribbed wholesale for &quot;eerie vibes&quot; but is quickly discarded for another trope---genre-appropriate but unfocused. Likewise with the throbbing concert bass drum that builds under climactic scenes which evokes an epic Peter Jackson battlefield scene more than a more intimate, ultimately character-driven horror. The music box introduction, for heaven's sake.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the work wants to borrow the trappings of the mid-century avant-garde and, by association, of other genre films but does not support them with any particular structure besides, evidently, some familial relation to this four-note motif. There's a core of good film music here, but it's drowned in a soup of genre-appropriate spooky ideas---not to mention a good deal too much reverb.</p>
<p>I'd like to identify the problem as an overeagerness to unify score and sound design... Had the score committed more fervently to its core motif (and development thereof) and stripped the instrumentation down to, say, a string quartet (befitting the era and sparseness of many of the sets, for instance), leaving the spooky sounds to the foley artist, I think it would have been a more successful production overall, sans undesirable sonic allusions to <em>Lord of the Rings</em>...</p>

<p class="par2"><p>Consider two improvisatory musical works: (a) the sculptural work which organizes sound in the traditional fashion (melody, rhythms, and changes fixed; improvisation included at predetermined points for fixed durations) and (b) the mobile work [if you like] whose structural elements are themselves determined in-the-moment. In the former category are many traditional jazz forms. Tunes from the Great American Songbook permit the time-tested fixed---open---fixed cyclical structure which forms the core of jazz practice. An Ellington big band arrangement fits the paradigm even more tightly given that so many voicings, hits, lines may be planned in advance for the fixed moments. The broad contours we associate with the work are fixed; repeatable; recognizable and open play is tightly constrained; rule-mediated.</p>
<p>Works in the latter category may (or may not) bear many of the same structured elements---fixed pitches, rhythms---but critically their arrangement in time is itself contingent on players' in-the-moment decisions. Game pieces; cellular compositions; asemantic &quot;graphic&quot; works. In BOTH types, the composer brings to the table encoded sounds or actions which disambiguate the work and the performer enacts these and further spins them out into a unique, improvised expression of that work.</p>
<p>I guess my question is this: How does the relationship between work and expression differ in structurally rigid v. structurally mobile improvisatory works?</p>
