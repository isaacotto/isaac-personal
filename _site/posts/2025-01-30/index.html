                    <p>Atticus gave me <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mingus_Plays_Piano">Mingus Plays Piano</a> (Impulse!, 1964) which I'd either never heard or heard so long ago as to have forgotten it. Phenomenal, personal album. I resist reading (as some might) his self-conscious-but-never-affected slop as a reflection of some DSM pathology... I think of it rather as a key stylistic element---a major creative factor in his work into which he leans quite deliberately. His left-hand ostinato fails in &quot;Myself When I Am Real&quot; when he develops an idea in the right because the pursuit of that little idea is more critical than the grid. That point of failure becomes a &quot;clumsy&quot; inflection point---not the sort of thing to be easily transcribed---marking the shift in attention from one gesture to another. And while it is the (points A and B) gestures that form the foreground of the work, the bits one might play if one covered the piece, the slop in between leaves a strong imprint; tints the work in a beautiful, original way that we don't yet know how to notate.</p>
<p>Likewise, it's clear to me that when Mingus (elsewhere) leans hard on an A♮ on the downbeat of a B♭m7 in the first measure of &quot;I X Love&quot; (&quot;Duke's Choice&quot;), he's doing something more than milking a leading tone for its friction, he's expressing that liminal &quot;slop&quot; harmonically. The chord really is a split seventh and that set---however briefly expressed on its way to its local resolution---defines the work in a way that it wouldn't in a normal, cadential figure.</p>
<p>The slop that reviewers reductively attribute to Mingus' lack of experience on the instrument (&quot;He's no virtuoso, but nevertheless...&quot;) plays out too in uneven melodic figurations---trills and brief runs in the head to &quot;Memories of You&quot; that clearly evoke Tatum (with whom he studied for a while, someone said) but which, contra Tatum, sputter and flam where they need to. This is an critical (a/e)ffect which Mingus carries with him into his role as a bandleader and suffuses his entire corpus, and is so key to the music's sublimity (mostly absent, I think, in the tribute records I've heard---I'd be happy to be wrong).</p>
<p>I guess I just lament that for a hundred reasons I mostly hear this sort of &quot;calculated&quot; failure play out in more wholly improvised musics and less in highly-idiomatic musics like jazz now---I want to be more confused about what's going on!</p>
