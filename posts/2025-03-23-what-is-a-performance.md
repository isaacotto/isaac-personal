# What is a performance?

Musical performances seem to pose a distinct intellectual challenge for FRBR/IFLA's WEMI model.

[Yale](https://web.library.yale.edu/cataloging/music/frbr-wemi-music), in describing the WEMI entities, gives as an example:

- Work: Die Zauberfl√∂te by Mozart
- Expression 1: original composer's score
- Expression 2: July 27, 1949 performance by the Konzertvereinigung Wiener Staatsopernchor

The IFLA LRM on the other hand gives no examples of performances for "expression". Instead, we get:

- [Expression] Vocal score of Giuseppe Verdi's Macbeth
- [Expression] A recording of a specific performance by the Amadeus Quartet and Hephzibah Menuhin on piano of Franz Schubert's *Trout quintet*

(Fascinatingly, they give no musical examples for "manifestation").

It seems to me that this indicates some confusion. How could a performance and a recording of that performance exist at the same ontological level, given that a classical performance is ontologically dependent on a particular arrangement of a work (what both IFLA and Yale are dangerously referring to as a "score") and a recording of a performance is clearly downstream of that performance?

In short, performances seem to have attributes belonging to each distinct ("disjoint!") level of the WEMI model:

- A performance is like a _work_: [??]
    - Its production may be a distinct intellectual creation. Choreography, set design, blocking, all contribute to a creative whole.
    - It may have a "creator" in the same way that a work does.
    - In the case of freely improvised music, attributes we associate with _works_ may come into being contemporaneously with the execution of the performance. Attributes which characterize the work are in this case inseparable from the performance itself.
- A performance is like an _expression_:
    - It instantiates a work, serves as a "fulfillment or realization of [an] idea through [...] sound" (Yale)
    - It serves as "a distinct combination of signs conveying intellectual or artistic content" (IFLA)
- A performance is like a _manifestation_:
    - It's "downstream" of a type of _expression_, i.e. it can't exist without a particular arrangement, which we have identified as an _expression_.
    - It "embodies" this _expression_ in a way that can be repeated (like repeated printings of an English translation of a book). 
    - It "results from the capture of one or more expressions onto a carrier" (IFLA). The expression in this case is a particular arrangement (the definition of "carrier" would have to be stretched somewhat to include human bodies; sound waves; human ears).
- A performance is like an _item_:
    - It exists in the world (albeit ephemerally).
    - It has temporal and physical extension.
    - No two performances will be exactly alike.
    - Multiple performances may be grouped together according to similar structure and extent.

I don't think that each of these characteristics are equally defensible, but these examples should illustrate that performances are weird, ontologically speaking, when we try to fit them into this model.
