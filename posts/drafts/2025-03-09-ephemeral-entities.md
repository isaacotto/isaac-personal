At the nascent stage of this little research project, I've been so starving for candid, well-informed discussion of the bones of the LRM, that I took a truly desperate measure and spoke to ChatGPT on the topic.

At the moment, I'm really just trying to formulate an objection to the way IFLA models relations between work, expression, manifestation, and item. The ontology of (musical) works is far from settled science, so I'm aware that I'm opening a much larger can of worms than I may be prepared to deal with, but this should at least serve as a gateway into bigger discussions that tie in my thoughts on notation as work-mediator.

One problem that keeps pebbling around my brain is the issue of the *uncaptured expression*.

Per IFLA LRM documentation:
1. An expression comes into being with the creation of its first manifestation.
2. An expression *cannot exist* without an associated manifestation.
3. A manifestation requires a *carrier* and results from the capture of one or more expressions.

Yet we have no difficulty conceiving of a musical work whose only expression remains uncaptured: any work premiered prior to the invention of recorded sound, for instance. Per the LRM, these uncaptured performances cannot be, at least bibliographically speaking, expressions at all, unless we were to define "capture" and "carrier" extraordinarily liberally.
